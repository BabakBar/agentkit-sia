# From your project directory
docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up -d

# Then start the frontend
cd frontend
pnpm dev


You don't need to rebuild everything unless you've made changes to:

Backend code
Environment variables (.env)
Dependencies

If you did make such changes, then use:
bashCopydocker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up -d --build

read the @/Sia.txt to underestand the project. time to customize and clean BCG Agentkit based on our needs. get ready to start with removing/cleaning the parts that we don't need. then we can start with our plan and customizing:
1- add other LLM models to handle all the major providers
2- add the bigquery connection to the agitkit as the main database knowledge that later can be used to query the GA database using SQL and agentic workflow

Project:
GA4 Analytics Agent PoC Development Plan

Project Overview
Development of a Proof of Concept for an AI-powered analytics agent that enables natural language querying of Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data using BCG AgentKit framework.
Goals & Objectives
	1. Create a functional agent capable of: 
		○ Processing natural language queries about GA4 data
		○ Generating accurate SQL queries for BigQuery
		○ Providing meaningful analytics insights
	2. Validate the technical feasibility of the solution
	3. Establish foundation for future production development
Technical Architecture
Core Components
	1. Data Layer 
		○ Source: GA4 BigQuery Export
		○ Storage: BigQuery (existing)
		○ Access: SQL query interface
	2. Intelligence Layer 
		○ Framework: BCG AgentKit
		○ LLM: OpenAI/Anthropic API
		○ Query Processing: Custom SQL generation tools
	3. Interface Layer 
		○ Query Input: Natural language
		○ Response: Formatted analytics insights
		○ Context: Session-based management
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Core Setup (1-2 weeks)
	1. Environment Setup 
		○ AgentKit configuration
		○ LLM API integration
		○ BigQuery connection setup
	2. Basic Tools Development 
		○ SQL query builder
		○ Response formatter
		○ Error handler
Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (2-3 weeks)
	1. Query Processing 
		○ GA4 schema mapping
		○ Query pattern recognition
		○ Context management system
	2. Response Generation 
		○ Data interpretation
		○ Insight generation
		○ Format standardization
Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (1-2 weeks)
	1. Validation 
		○ Unit testing
		○ Integration testing
		○ Performance benchmarking
	2. Documentation 
		○ Technical documentation
		○ Usage guidelines
		○ Future recommendations
